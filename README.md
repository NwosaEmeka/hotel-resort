# hotel-resort

In this project, I used HTML and CSS to recreate static version of John Smilga React Beach Hotel Project

Javascript was used to get the value of range slider on input

Please comment and let me know how to improve my code in the future, Thanks

The final project can be viewed here https://nwosaemeka.github.io/hotel-resort/
